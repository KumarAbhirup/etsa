# Presidential Executive Orders

The President of ETSA has the power to sign executive orders. 

An executive order is a means of issuing federal directives, used by the President of the ETSA, that manages operations of the federal government. 

Presidential executive orders, once issued, remain in force until they are canceled, revoked, adjudicated unlawful, or expire on their terms.

## EO 2: Making elections more frequent

The constitution has set the Presidential Term Limits to two months. This executive order will reduce the election cycle to every 2 weeks. Yes, it does override the constitution, perhaps in a way that may deem unconstitutional, but I am hoping that this Executive Order shall be reversed someday later when we get enough members in the commonwealth.
